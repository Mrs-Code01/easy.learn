                The Berlin <span id="spanone">treaty</span> was as a result of the rivalry between Great Britain and
                France. This treaty meeting
                was by Bismarck to intervene and bring the rivalry to an end. He called the European powers for a
                meeting in the Berlin conference of 1884/1885. In subsequent meetings, Great Britain, France, Germany,
                Portugal and Leopold II of Belgium negotiated their claims to African territories, which were then
                formalized and mapped.

                    <b>1. FRIENDLY PREFACE:</b> This <span id="spantwo">feature</span> of the Berlin treaty was to
                    enable the British who had no
                    previous history of protracted / long relations to maintain peaceful co-existence. Secondly, the
                    above treaty was made because the British and Itsekiri chiefs were desirous of maintaining and
                    strengthening the relation of peace and friendship which had so long existed between them.
